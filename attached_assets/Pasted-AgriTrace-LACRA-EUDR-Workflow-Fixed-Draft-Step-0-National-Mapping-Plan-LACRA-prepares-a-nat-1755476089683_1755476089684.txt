AgriTrace LACRA (EUDR Workflow – Fixed Draft)

Step 0 – National Mapping Plan
•	LACRA prepares a national plan to map all farms.

Step 1 – Inspector Registration
•	LACRA registers all assigned inspectors by county/area in the AgriTrace system.

Step 2 – Farmer Onboarding & Mapping
•	Inspector maps farm plots.
•	Farm output estimated (via satellite or manual calculation).
•	Farmer information and data registered.
•	EUDR & deforestation status generated and viewed → confirms compliance (positive/negative).
•	Note: Farmers cannot sell crops if their farm is not mapped.

Step 3 – Farmer to Licensed Agents/Buyers  Communication
•	Farmers notify Licensed Agents/Licensed Agents/Buyers when crops are ready (harvest).
•	If online → farmers use the AgriTrace Platform.
•	If offline → farmers use SMS gateway (1111) or bulk SMS services provided by telecom/third-party.
How the SMS System Works:
1.	Farmer sends SMS to shortcode (e.g., 1111) in this format: FarmerID, Crop Type, Quantity, Contact Number.
2.	Telecom system checks farmer ID and broadcasts to all Licensed Agents/Licensed Agents/Buyers in the county.
3.	Licensed Agents/Licensed Agents/Buyers s (opted-in via LACRA) receive SMS and may contact farmer directly.
•	Each county has its own dedicated gateway number (15 in total).
•	Sales are on a first-come-first-served basis.
•	A unique reference/confirmation code is generated once Farmer & Licensed Agents/Buyers  agree. Code is sent to Licensed Agents/Buyers ’s phone and automatically registered in AgriTrace. 
•	Code includes details: volume, crop type, location, farmer, and Licensed Agents/Buyers contact details

Step 4 – Traceable Bag Collection
•	Licensed Agents/Buyers goes to government warehouse to collect traceable bags linked to the unique reference code.
•	Government inspector releases bags equal to the crop volume (e.g., 65 bags for 5 tons).
•	Bags issued by LACRA & Eco Enviros after payment.

Step 5 – Collection of Crops from Farmer 
•	Licensed Agents/Buyer will go back to the Farmer to collect the crops
•	Consecutively a payment will be made by the Licensed Agents/Buyers to the farmer for the crop
•	Farmer will release the crops to the Licensed Agents/Buyers  
•	Farmer confirms payment by sending a “lot sale and paid” message to a gateway (2222) with details: Farmer ID, crop type, quantity, and Licensed Agents/Buyers ID.
•	If payment is not confirmed the government warehouse will not receive the crops. 
•	This will send a confirmation too to the Licensed Agents/Buyer and automatically registered the transaction complete in the AgriTrace Portal
•	Traceable bag collected will be used to transport crops back to the government warehouse.

Step 6 – Government Warehouse / Supply Chain  Traceability
•	Product delivered → basic quantity & quality check by Lacra and EcoEnviros.
•	Batch code scanning for crop arrival confirmation
•	Product data registered in AgriTrace 
•	Registered and Evaluated Product will be stored in the said warehouse 
•	It will be re-assigned to the Licensed Agents/Buyer that crops is ready for release to Lacra Regisered or Licensed Exporter.




Step 7 – Licensed Agents/Buyers  to Exporter Communication
•	Licensed Agents/Buyers  logs into AgriTrace portal, opens Exporter Tab.
•	Selects an Exporter and proposes sale.
•	Exporter accepts or declines via messaging system:
o	If Accepts → new unique reference number generated.
o	If Declines → Licensed Agents/Buyers  contacts next exporter.

Step 8 – Warehouse Transfer
•	Once Exporter accepts, government warehouse authorizes transfer of crops to exporter warehouse.

Step 9 – Exporter Warehouse Confirmation
•	Exporter request basic inspection
•	Inspector confirms arrival via batch code scan.
•	LACRA & Eco Enviros inspect for quality & quantity.
•	Confirmation report submitted into AgriTrace, synced to Exporter Portal.

Step 10 – Payment to Licensed Agents/Buyers 
•	Licensed Agents/Buyers confirms receipt of payment from Exporter via AgriTrace portal.
Payment Conditions Option (Mandatory/Non-Mandatory):
•	Exporter may pay within 7 business days. (Mandatory)
•	Late payment penalties: (Subject to agreement between Licensed Agent Buyer/Exporter (Non-Mandatory))
o	7–15 days = daily interest fee (set by LACRA).
o	15–30 days = double interest.
o	After 30 days = exporter’s license suspended, transaction cancelled, product reassigned.
•	Licensed Agents/Buyers  may reclaim crops if exporter fails to pay.
•	Exporter Warehouse holds product max 30 days (free of charge) → if unsold, returned to Licensed Agents/Buyers .


 
Step 11 – Export Preparation
•	Exporter processes crops (cleaning, drying, bagging).
•	Exporter requests Quality Check & Export Permit via Exporter Portal.
•	LACRA & Eco Enviros schedule inspection.

Step 12 – Quality & Compliance Check
•	Final inspection for quality & quantity subject to international standard
•	Fumigation conducted.
•	Reports auto-generated (viewable only by regulators):
o	EUDR Compliance Fee
o	Quality Control Fee
o	Satellite Monitoring Fees
o	Deforestation Certificate Fee
o	Certificate of Origin Fee
o	Fumigation & Phytosanitary Fees
o	Good Practice Certificate Fee

Step 13 – Payment of Reports & Fees
•	Payments made through AgriTrace for:
o	EUDR Compliance Fee
o	Quality Control Fee
o	Satellite Monitoring Fees
o	Deforestation Certificate Fee
o	Certificate of Origin Fee
o	Fumigation & Phytosanitary Fees
o	Good Practice Certificate Fee
•	Export Permit & LACRA Royalty Fee paid separately.

Step 14 – Report Release
•	Once payment confirmed, reports available to the Exporter for download 
•	Exporter ready to proceed with international shipment.
