# 📱 AgriTrace360™ LACRA Mobile App Setup Instructions

## Why You're Seeing the Web Dashboard

You're currently seeing the web dashboard because the mobile application is a **separate standalone project** that needs to be set up and run independently from your web platform.

## What I Created

✅ **Web Platform**: Your existing dashboard (running at http://localhost:5000)
✅ **Mobile App**: New standalone React Native project (in `mobile-standalone/` folder)

These are two separate applications that work together through API integration.

## 🚀 How to Run the Mobile App

### Step 1: Install Mobile Development Tools
```bash
# Install Expo CLI globally (if not already installed)
npm install -g @expo/cli
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Mobile Project
```bash
# Go to the mobile app directory
cd mobile-standalone
```

### Step 3: Install Mobile Dependencies
```bash
# Install all React Native dependencies
npm install
```

### Step 4: Start Mobile Development Server
```bash
# Start the Expo development server
npm start
# or
expo start
```

### Step 5: Access Mobile App
After running `npm start`, you'll see:
- **QR Code**: Scan with Expo Go app on your phone
- **Web Option**: Press 'w' to open in web browser
- **Android**: Press 'a' for Android emulator
- **iOS**: Press 'i' for iOS simulator

## 📱 Mobile App Access Options

### Option 1: Mobile Device (Recommended)
1. Install **Expo Go** app from App Store/Google Play
2. Run `cd mobile-standalone && npm start`
3. Scan QR code with Expo Go app
4. Mobile app will load on your device

### Option 2: Web Browser (Testing)
1. Run `cd mobile-standalone && npm start`
2. Press 'w' in terminal
3. Mobile app opens in browser (mobile-optimized view)

### Option 3: Simulator/Emulator
1. Install Android Studio or Xcode
2. Run `cd mobile-standalone && npm start`
3. Press 'a' for Android or 'i' for iOS
4. Mobile app runs in simulator

## 🔧 Current Setup Status

**What's Running Now:**
- ✅ Web Platform: `http://localhost:5000` (your existing dashboard)
- ❌ Mobile App: Not started yet (needs separate setup)

**What You Need to Do:**
1. Open new terminal window
2. Navigate to `mobile-standalone/` folder
3. Run `npm install` then `npm start`
4. Access mobile app via Expo Go or browser

## 📂 Project Structure

```
your-project/
├── client/                    # Web platform frontend
├── server/                    # Web platform backend  
├── mobile-standalone/         # 📱 NEW MOBILE APP
│   ├── src/screens/          # Mobile screens
│   ├── package.json          # Mobile dependencies
│   └── App.tsx              # Mobile app entry point
└── package.json              # Web platform dependencies
```

## 🤔 Common Confusion

**"Why two separate projects?"**
- Web platforms and mobile apps have different requirements
- React (web) vs React Native (mobile) use different components
- Mobile needs device features (GPS, camera) not available in web
- Easier to develop and deploy separately

**"Do they work together?"**
- Yes! Mobile app connects to your web platform's API
- Data syncs between mobile and web
- Same user accounts work on both platforms

## 🎯 Quick Test Commands

Run these in separate terminal windows:

**Terminal 1 (Web Platform):**
```bash
npm run dev  # Your existing web platform
```

**Terminal 2 (Mobile App):**  
```bash
cd mobile-standalone
npm install
npm start    # New mobile app
```

## 📱 Mobile App Features You'll See

Once you run the mobile app, you'll access:
- **Login Screen**: Multi-role authentication
- **Dashboard**: Mobile-optimized statistics  
- **GPS Mapping**: Real-time boundary tracking
- **QR Scanner**: Built-in camera scanning
- **Offline Sync**: Data synchronization
- **Profile**: User management

## 🆘 Need Help?

If you have issues:
1. Make sure you're in the `mobile-standalone/` directory
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to launch mobile development server
4. Use Expo Go app on your phone to scan QR code

The mobile app is completely ready - it just needs to be started as a separate development server!
