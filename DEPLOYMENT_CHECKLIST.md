# AgriTrace360 Android APK Deployment Checklist

## Before Starting Android Studio

### 1. Deploy Your Web Platform
- [ ] Deploy your AgriTrace360 platform to a public URL (Replit deployment)
- [ ] Test that all portals work on the public URL:
  - [ ] Regulatory Portal (admin001/admin123)

   - Wait for deployment to complete
   - Copy your deployment URL

2. **Update the MainActivity.java file** with your actual URL:
   ```java
   private static final String PLATFORM_URL = "https://your-actual-deployment-url.replit.app";
   ```
