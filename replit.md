# AgriTrace360™ - Agricultural Commodity Compliance Management System

## Overview
AgriTrace360™ is a comprehensive web application for the Liberia Agriculture Commodity Regulatory Authority (LACRA), designed to manage and monitor agricultural commodity compliance across Liberian counties. It provides real-time tracking of commodities, inspections, certifications, and compliance metrics through an intuitive dashboard. The system aims to enhance transparency, efficiency, and regulatory oversight in Liberia's agricultural sector, contributing to food safety, sustainable practices, and adherence to international standards like the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR). It offers multi-role access for regulatory staff, farmers, field agents, and exporters, streamlining workflows from farm to export. The project also encompasses an expanded "Polipus" platform with 8 specialized modules, including: Agricultural Traceability & Compliance, Live Trace, Land Map360, Mine Watch, Forest Guard, Aqua Trace, Blue Carbon 360, and Carbon Trace.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Maintenance Page Preference: Always use the generic maintenance page template (red gradient background, "Website Maintenance" title, no specific branding) for any maintenance page requests. This template is stored in server/index.ts as inline HTML.
Module Development Strategy: Ready to simultaneously develop all 7 new modules (Live Trace, Land Map360, Mine Watch, Forest Guard, Aqua Trace, Blue Carbon 360, Carbon Trace) with complete functionality, maintaining consistent ISMS.online-inspired design system and professional standards from AgriTrace360. Will create full database schemas, backend APIs, frontend interfaces, and cross-module integration for each portal.
PDF Report Design Preference: User confirmed satisfaction with enhanced professional design approach featuring comprehensive charts, graphs, and visual elements. Prefers clean synchronized formatting with advanced data visualizations including radar charts, 3D pie charts, bar charts with benchmarks, and timeline flow diagrams across all 6 certificates. Recently updated to use UniDOC-inspired professional style with dashboard-style metrics, color-coded risk indicators, progress bars, and network diagrams as shown in reference image.
