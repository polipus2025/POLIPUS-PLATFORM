3. üßæ Data Requirements
What data must be collected, stored, and tracked.
Common Across Modules:
‚Ä¢	Entity Profile (Farmer, Miner, Landowner, Vessel, etc.)
‚Ä¢	Location (Geo-coordinates, county, district)
‚Ä¢	Ownership Documents / Permits / Licenses
‚Ä¢	Type of Activity (e.g. Crop Type, Mining Material)
‚Ä¢	Status (Active, Pending, Suspended, Rejected)
‚Ä¢	Compliance Check Records
‚Ä¢	Certification Info (Organic, Fair Trade, Carbon)
‚Ä¢	Supporting Documents (Photos, ID, Survey Forms)
‚Ä¢	QR Code or Digital Trace ID
‚Ä¢	Timeline of Actions (Audit Trail)
Module-Specific Example (MineWatch‚Ñ¢):
‚Ä¢	Mining License #
‚Ä¢	Extraction Volume
‚Ä¢	Environmental Impact Records
‚Ä¢	Export Shipment Logs

4. üîÅ Business Logic / Workflows
How the system should behave based on user actions.
Example: Permit Workflow (simplified)
1.	User registers entity (e.g., cocoa farm, mine site)
2.	Uploads documents & applies for permit
3.	Ministry reviews submission
o	If compliant ‚Üí Permit is issued
o	If not compliant ‚Üí Rejection or Inspection Request
4.	QR Code generated for traceability
5.	Ongoing monitoring (compliance visits, export logs)
6.	Permit renewal initiated before expiration
Other workflows:
‚Ä¢	Site Violation ‚ûù Inspection ‚ûù Suspension ‚ûù Rectification
‚Ä¢	Field Agent collects data offline ‚ûù Syncs to cloud
‚Ä¢	QR Code scanned by customs ‚ûù Validation of permit/export

5. üîó Integration Points
How each module communicates with others.
Module	Connected To	Purpose
AgriTrace360‚Ñ¢	ChainScan‚Ñ¢, CarbonTrace‚Ñ¢, ESG Monitor	Export validation, carbon credit eligibility
MineWatch‚Ñ¢	ForestGuard‚Ñ¢, CarbonTrace‚Ñ¢, LandMap‚Ñ¢	Location conflict checks, compliance, ownership
LandMap‚Ñ¢	LLA System, ForestGuard‚Ñ¢, MineWatch‚Ñ¢	Verify land rights, boundaries, overlapping licenses
AquaTrace‚Ñ¢	BlueCarbon360‚Ñ¢, ESG Monitor	Marine compliance, coastal carbon analysis
ChainScan‚Ñ¢	All modules + LRA + Customs	Logistics, customs integration, export certification
ESG Monitor	All modules	National compliance tracking for presidency & donors
SecureGov API	All Ministries	Role-based access to shared data

‚úÖ Example Use Case: AgriTrace360‚Ñ¢ for MoA & LACRA
Core Features: Farmer registration, batch certification, QR scan for exports
User Roles: Farmers (limited), Inspectors (entry), MoA officials (review)
Data Requirements: Land size, crop type, harvest details, cooperative ID
Business Logic: QR is only generated once field agent validates batch
Integration: Connects with ChainScan for export tracking, ESG Monitor for compliance reporting
