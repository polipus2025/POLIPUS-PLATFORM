# AgriTrace360™ Crop Planting & Harvest Schedule Workflow

## Complete Farmer Journey: Land to Market

### Phase 1: Farmer Onboarding & Land Mapping
**Responsibility: Land Inspector**

1. **Farmer Registration**
   - Land Inspector creates farmer account in system
   - Assigns unique Farmer ID (e.g., FARM-1755271600707-BQA7R4QFP)
   - Records basic farmer information (name, location, contact)

2. **Professional Land Mapping**
   - Land Inspector visits farmer's property
   - Uses GPS technology to map plot boundaries
   - Records plot details:
     - Plot name and size (hectares)
     - Soil type and quality
     - Water sources and irrigation
     - GPS coordinates and boundaries
     - EUDR compliance assessment
     - Deforestation risk analysis

3. **Land Verification**
   - Inspector validates land ownership
   - Checks legal compliance
   - Creates official land mapping record
   - Links mapped plots to farmer account

### Phase 2: Farmer Crop Planning & Scheduling
**Responsibility: Farmer**

4. **Access Farmer Dashboard**
   - Login with provided credentials
   - Navigate to "Crop Scheduling" tab
   - View mapped land plots available for planting

5. **Create Crop Schedule**
   - Select mapped plot for planting
   - Choose crop type (Cocoa, Coffee, Palm Oil, Rubber, Rice, Cassava)
   - Select crop variety (e.g., Trinitario Cocoa, Arabica Coffee)
   - Set planting details:
     - Planting area (within mapped plot)
     - Planting date
     - Expected harvest date
     - Expected yield (kg)

6. **Schedule Validation**
   - System validates against mapped plot capacity
   - Checks crop suitability for land type
   - Confirms planting schedule feasibility
   - Creates unique Schedule ID

### Phase 3: Crop Growth & Monitoring
**Responsibility: Farmer + System**

7. **Growth Tracking**
   - Farmer updates crop status: Planned → Planted → Growing
   - System tracks growth timeline
   - Sends harvest readiness alerts
   - Monitors expected vs actual timelines

8. **Pre-Harvest Preparation**
   - System notifies when crop approaches harvest date
   - Farmer receives "Ready for Harvest" alerts
   - Quality assessment preparation
   - Storage location planning

### Phase 4: Harvest Management & Automatic Batch Code Generation
**Responsibility: Farmer + Automatic System**

9. **Harvest Execution**
   - Farmer marks crop as "Ready for Harvest"
   - Records actual harvest details:
     - Actual yield (kg)
     - Quality grade (Grade I, Grade II, Premium, etc.)
     - Harvest completion date
     - Storage location

10. **AUTOMATIC BATCH CODE GENERATION** 
    - System immediately generates unique batch code: `BATCH-CROPTYPE-TIMESTAMP-FARMERID`
    - Batch code contains complete harvest lot information
    - System updates crop status to "Harvested"
    - Calculates yield efficiency vs expectations

11. **AUTOMATIC STAKEHOLDER NOTIFICATIONS**
    - **Land Inspector**: Notified of harvest completion for mapped plot
    - **Warehouse Inspector**: Alerted about yield quantity ready for inspection
    - **Three-Tier Regulatory Panels (DG/DDGOTS/DDGAF)**: Receive batch code and compliance data
    - **Marketplace System**: Automatically enables listing eligibility
    - **Buyer Network**: Harvest becomes visible in buyer marketplace

### Phase 5: Marketplace & Buyer Connection
**Responsibility: Farmer + Buyers**

11. **Create Marketplace Listing**
    - Farmer creates listing from harvested crop
    - Sets listing details:
      - Quantity available for sale
      - Price per kg
      - Quality specifications
      - Storage location
      - Harvest date verification

12. **Buyer Discovery**
    - Listing appears in buyer marketplace
    - Buyers can view crop details and farmer profile
    - System tracks listing views and interest
    - Buyers submit purchase inquiries

13. **Transaction Negotiation**
    - Buyers send price offers and quantity requests
    - Farmer receives inquiry notifications
    - Negotiation through platform messaging
    - Terms agreement (price, quantity, delivery)

14. **Sale Completion**
    - Buyer and farmer agree on terms
    - System generates unique transaction code
    - DDGOTS notification for export oversight
    - QR batch code generation for traceability

### Phase 6: Traceability & Compliance
**Responsibility: System + Regulatory**

15. **QR Batch Generation**
    - System creates QR batch code for sold crop
    - Links to complete history:
      - Farm plot GPS coordinates
      - Planting and harvest dates
      - Quality assessments
      - Transaction details
      - Buyer information

16. **Regulatory Compliance**
    - EUDR compliance documentation
    - Export permit processing (if applicable)
    - International standards verification
    - Chain of custody documentation

17. **Supply Chain Visibility**
    - Complete farm-to-market traceability
    - Real-time tracking updates
    - Quality assurance records
    - Compliance certification

## Sample Workflow Timeline

**Month 1**: Land mapping by Inspector
**Month 2**: Farmer creates crop schedule (Cocoa planting)
**Month 2-8**: Crop growth and monitoring
**Month 8**: Harvest completion and quality assessment
**Month 8**: Marketplace listing creation
**Month 8-9**: Buyer discovery and negotiation
**Month 9**: Sale completion and QR batch generation
**Month 9+**: Export processing and international delivery

This workflow ensures complete traceability from mapped farm plots to international markets while maintaining farmer focus on agricultural productivity rather than administrative mapping tasks.
