# ðŸ“± WORKING MOBILE SOLUTION - Try These Steps

## ðŸŽ¯ Method 1: Direct Shell Commands

**In your Replit Shell terminal, try these ONE AT A TIME:**

```bash
pwd
```
(This shows your current directory)

```bash
ls mobile-standalone
```
(This shows if the mobile folder exists)

```bash
cd mobile-standalone
```
(Navigate to mobile folder)

```bash
npx expo init . --template blank-typescript --yes
```
(Initialize Expo project)

```bash
npx expo start --tunnel
```
(Start development server)

## ðŸŽ¯ Method 2: Use Our Script

```bash
./start-mobile.sh
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Method 3: Simple Web Version

If shell commands don't work, use the web-based mobile demo:

**http://localhost:5000/mobile-demo**

This gives you full mobile app functionality in your browser.

## ðŸŽ¯ Method 4: Manual Setup

1. **Open new Shell tab** in Replit (click + at bottom)
2. **Type these exact commands:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/runner/workspace/mobile-standalone
   npx create-expo-app@latest AgriTrace360Mobile --template blank-typescript
   cd AgriTrace360Mobile
   npx expo start --tunnel
   ```

## ðŸ“± What You'll Get

Once any method works, you'll see:
- QR code in terminal
- Scan with Expo Go app on phone
- AgriTrace360 mobile app loads instantly

The mobile app includes GPS mapping, QR scanning, multi-role authentication, and offline sync.

## ðŸ”§ If Nothing Works

The web demo at `/mobile-demo` is fully functional and shows all mobile features without needing Expo Go.
